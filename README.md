Dotfiles
========
This repository includes all of my custom dotfiles. The setup scripts backs up the necessary dotfiles first and then symlinks the new dotfiles to those in the `~/dotfiles`.

Installation
------------

Prerequisites: `zsh` and `oh-my-zsh`

Then you can do the following:
``` bash
git clone git://github.com/marchdf/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```
